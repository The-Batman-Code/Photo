## How to test?
1. Download and paste the address of the test.jsonl file in the python script.
2. Keep a few images in a test folder, paste the addresses of those images in the test.jsonl file and replace all the '\\' with '_' .
3. Change the coordinates accordingly in the test.jsonl file(keep in mind that the image has been resized to 720x500 pixels in the python script).
4. Run the script.
